SOME ISSUES BUG FIXING ETC.
1)  Power Querry transforming decimal numbers from 0.0 format to 0,0, because of polish excel
2)  IDENTIFYING **2 PROBLEMS** **1:** YEARS 2017 and 2020 ARE MISSING A LOT OF VALUES AND 2016 HAVE ONLY A THIRD OF IT'S DATA// **2:** THERE IS N/A ERROR IN YEARS

IDEAS.
1)  In chart 1. global sales by category and game I learnt that I can add labels automaticly from my specified array to change way my chart looks. (POMYSL NA GIF JAK TO ROBISZ W PRZYSZ≈ÅOSCI) 

TEPS TAKEN)
1)  taking unique values of Platform tab from DATA, googling full names and assinging them to company, creating table: platforms - relation with DATA(one-to-many)
2)  taking unique publishers, asked ChatGpt to give me csv file as: "Company","Country". "Country" informs where publisher is registered, creating table publisher - relation with DATA(one-to-many)
3)  Using Power Querry to add those 3 data tables to model and combaining them into database where in table DATA: Primary Key is Rank, Foreing Key(Primary for platforms) is Platform, Foreing Key(Primary for publisher) is Publisher
